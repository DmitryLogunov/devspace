With a DevSpace, you can build, test and run **code directly inside any Kubernetes cluster**. You can run `devspace up` in any of your projects and the client-only DevSpace CLI will start a DevSpace within your Kubernetes cluster. Keep coding as usual and the DevSpace CLI will sync any code change directly into the containers of your DevSpace. 

**No more waiting** for re-building images, re-deploying containers and restarting applications on every source code change. Simply edit your code with any IDE and run your code instantly inside your DevSpace.

## Why use DevSpace?
Program inside any Kubernetes cluster (e.g. minikube, self-hosted or cloud platform) and:
- iterate quickly: no more building and pushing images on every change, use **hot reloading** instead (e.g. with nodemon)
- keep your existing workflow and tools: **the DevSpace CLI works with every IDE** (no plugins required)
- access cluster-internal services and data during development
- debug efficiently with port forwarding and terminal proxying
- migrate to Docker & Kubernetes within minutes

## Demo
This demo shows how to run `devspace up` directly from the terminal inside Visual Studio Code. However, the DevSpace CLI is not a plugin and will work with any terminal. In this example, we are starting a DevSpace for a React application.

## [Install & Quickstart Guide](https://devspace-cloud.com/getting-started/)
Follow this link for the [Install & Quickstart Guide](https://devspace-cloud.com/getting-started/).

After installing the DevSpace CLI, you can create a DevSpace for any existing project with just a single command:
```
devspace up
```
Take a look at the [Install & Getting Started Guide](https://devspace-cloud.com/getting-started/) to see how to get started with a DevSpace.

**Note:** Don't worry, you can use `devspace reset` to reset your project and go back to local development.

## [Architecture](https://docs.devspace-cloud.com/docs/advanced/architecture.html)
Architecturally, the DevSpace CLI is a client-side software that interacts with services within your Kubernetes cluster. While the DevSpace CLI can deploy required services (e.g. image registry, Tiller server, Kaniko build pods) automatically, you can also configure it to use already deployed or externally hosted services.

For a more detailed description of the internals of the DevSpace CLI, take a look at the [Architecture Documentation](https://docs.devspace-cloud.com/docs/advanced/architecture.html).

**Note:** Any interaction between your local computer and your DevSpace is passed through your Kubernetes API server, so you should ensure that your API server is protected with a suitable configuration for using TLS.
