# Php Mysql example

This example shows you how to develop a small php web application that uses mysql as a database.

# Step 0: Prerequisites

In order to use this example, make sure you have docker installed and a docker registry where you can push to (hub.docker.com, gcr.io etc.). Make sure you are logged in to the registry via `docker login`.  

Exchange the image name in `.devspace/config.yaml` under `images.default.name` with the image name you want to use. Do **not** add a tag to this image name, because this will be done at runtime automatically.  

## Optional: Use self hosted cluster (minikube, GKE etc.) instead of devspace-cloud

By default, this example will deploy to the devspace-cloud, a free managed kubernetes cluster. If you want to use your own cluster instead of the devspace-cloud as deployment target, make sure `kubectl` is configured correctly to access resources on the cluster. Then just erase the `cluster` section in the `.devspace/config.yaml` and devspace will use your current `kubectl` context as deployment target.  

# Step 1: Start the devspace

To deploy the application to the devspace-cloud simply run `devspace up`. The output of the command should look similar to this: 

```

```

The command built your Dockerfile and pushed it to the target docker registry. Afterwards, it created a new kubernetes namespace for you in the devspace-cloud and deployed the `kube/deployment.yaml` to that namespace. It also created a new kubectl context for you. You can check the running pods via `kubectl get po`.

Furthermore a bi-directional sync was started between the local folder `/go-workspace/src/github.com/covexo/devspace/examples/php-mysql-example` and `/var/www/html` within the docker container. Whenever you change a file in either of those two folders the change will be synchronized. In addition the container port 80 was forwarded to your local port 3000.  

# Step 2: Start developing

Navigate in your browser to `localhost:3000` and you should a signin page. If you submit the form, the application will insert a new entry in the `Users` table of the mysql database. Try changing the `index.php` locally and reload the webpage and you should be able to see the changes immediately.
