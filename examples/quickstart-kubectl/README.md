# Quickstart kubectl example

This example shows you how to develop a small node express application with devspace and devspace-cloud using kubectl as deployment method instead of helm.

# Step 0: Prerequisites

In order to use this example, make sure you have docker installed and a docker registry where you can push to (hub.docker.com, gcr.io etc.). Make sure you are logged in to the registry via `docker login`.  

Exchange the image name in `.devspace/config.yaml` under `images.default.name` with the image name you want to use. Do the same thing in `kube/deployment.yaml` under `spec.template.spec.image`. Do **not** add a tag to those image names, because this will be done at runtime automatically.  

## Optional: Use self hosted cluster (minikube, GKE etc.) instead of devspace-cloud

If you want to use your own cluster instead of the devspace-cloud as deployment target, make sure `kubectl` is configured correctly to access your cluster. Then just erase the `cluster` section in the `.devspace/config.yaml` and devspace will use your current `kubectl` context as deployment target.  

# Step 1: Start the devspace

To deploy the application to the devspace-cloud simply run `devspace up`. The output of the command should look similar to this: 

```

```

The command built your Dockerfile and pushed it to the target docker registry. Afterwards, it created a new kubernetes namespace for you in the devspace-cloud and deployed the `kube/deployment.yaml` to that namespace. It also created a new kubectl context for you. You can check the running pods via `kubectl get po`.

Furthermore a bi-directional sync was started between the local folder `/go-workspace/src/github.com/covexo/devspace/examples/quickstart-kubectl` and `/app` within the docker container. Whenever you change a file in either of those two folders the change will be synchronized. In addition the container port 3000 was forwarded to your local port 3000.  

# Step 2: Start developing

You can start the server now with `npm start` in the open terminal. Now navigate in your browser to `localhost:3000` and you should see the output 'Hello World!'.  

Change something in `index.js` locally and you should see something like this: 

```
[nodemon] 1.18.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Example app listening on port 3000!
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Example app listening on port 3000!
```

Now just refresh your browser and you should see the changes immediately.
